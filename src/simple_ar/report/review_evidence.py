Pointers are not filesystem paths, URLs or paths into an earlier request. For numbers/bools/null quote the complete JSON value. Changed words/numbers/paths still fail; no automatic correction or dehyphenation, and an invalid supplied quote is never replaced by a field reference.",

Style/omission findings need not fabricate a quotation from text that does not exist.",

The historical name verified_execution_results does not certify method correctness.",

They may support length/style findings but cannot by themselves establish a definite metric mismatch.",

Do not label declaration or producer output as executor_record. Compare the correct roles; disagreement between a requested condition and observed execution is not itself a false description of that observed execution.",
